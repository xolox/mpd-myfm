 * Peter: Select random similar artists instead of tracks, because otherwise
          the number of tracks per artist influences the randomness too much?
          (of course this assumes each artist has several tracks)
 * Peter: Fall back on favorite tracks when no similar tracks exist?
 * Peter: Cache the similar artists retrieved from Last.fm?
 * Peter: When the last track doesn't have a genre, search the other tracks in
          the Media Player Daemon library by the same artist for a genre.
          Optionally also support multiple genres?
 * Bart: Add LIRC support for controlling mpd-myfm functions
         (i.e. toggle album and song mode).
 * Bart: Later probably more standard mpd functions (i.e. play and next).
 * Bart: Add an option to make mpd-myfm not add long songs (i.e. uncut live
         sets or LP's), maybe disabled in album mode?
 * Peter: When :wumpscut: starts playing on Peter's MPD setup, only tracks by
          :wumpscut: are added to the play list. This happens because none of
          the similar artists returned by Last.fm exist in Peter's MPD library,
          which makes the script fall back to the list of tracks from the same
          genre, where :wumpscut: always sorts before VNV Nation (the only
          other artist in Peter's library with the same genre: EBM) which means
          only tracks by :wumpscut: are selected by the script. A roundabout
          but ultimately very useful way of fixing this problem is to select
          artists in genre instead of tracks in genre, to run
          demoteplayedartists() on the selected artists, and to pick a random
          track by a random artist from the resulting list.
 * Peter: We're clearly still getting used to the way Python handles string
          encoding because this morning I found the following output in my
          screen session:

          mpd-myfm: INFO Added Picastro/Metal Cares/05. I Can't Fall Asleep.mp3 to play list.
          mpd-myfm: DEBUG demoted 6 artists because they have recently been played.

 * Peter: Decouple the play list generator from the Music Player Daemon
          interfacing code so that other music players can be supported.
          Specifically, I want to support Rhythmbox which shouldn't be too hard
          because there's "rhythmbox-client" and the music library is available
          in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml...
 * Peter: Bart implemented most the daemon code because he wanted to run the
          script as a daemon. Unfortunately he didn't document where the pieces
          of the puzzle go, which is why I just spend more than an hour getting
          the script to run from /etc/init.d/mpd-myfm :-). Anyway, it turned
          out that /etc/init.d/mpd-myfm wouldn't work until I'd started the
          script as a daemon manually once. Maybe it's got something to do with
          the access rights of the PID file? Apart from fixing the bug we need
          to add an INSTALL file to the repository ASAP.
 * Peter: My mpd-myfm daemon just 'died' because of a connection timeout while
          connecting to Last.fm from the function lastfm.get_similar_artists():
            File "/usr/lib/python2.5/httplib.py", line 683, in connect
              raise socket.error, msg
            IOError: [Errno socket error] (110, 'Connection timed out')
          Maybe the main loop should be restarted when such errors occur?
