 * Peter: Fall back on favorite tracks when no similar tracks exist?
 * Peter: Cache the similar artists retrieved from Last.fm?
 * Peter: When the last track doesn't have a genre, search the other tracks in
          the Media Player Daemon library by the same artist for a genre.
          Optionally also support multiple genres?
 * Bart: Add an option to make mpd-myfm not add long songs (i.e. uncut live
         sets or LP's), maybe disabled in album mode?
 * Peter: When :wumpscut: starts playing on Peter's MPD setup, only tracks by
          :wumpscut: are added to the play list. This happens because none of
          the similar artists returned by Last.fm exist in Peter's MPD library,
          which makes the script fall back to the list of tracks from the same
          genre, where :wumpscut: always sorts before VNV Nation (the only
          other artist in Peter's library with the same genre: EBM) which means
          only tracks by :wumpscut: are selected by the script. A roundabout
          but ultimately very useful way of fixing this problem is to select
          artists in genre instead of tracks in genre, to run
          demoteplayedartists() on the selected artists, and to pick a random
          track by a random artist from the resulting list.
