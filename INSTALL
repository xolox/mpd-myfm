Documentation on where the pieces of the mpd-myfm puzzle go.

To use mpd-myfm you need python version 2.5 or above (not python 3) and must
install the python mpdclient module which is available on most distributions as
a package.

If you just want to run mpd-myfm manually from your home, you can copy the
whole directory you got from git to wherever you want.
To use a config file edit "~/.mpd-myfm".

If you plan on using mpd-myfm as a daemon process running from init.d or
Upstart you have to copy a few files.

 * Copy the lastfm.py, mpdunicode.py, mpdlibrary.py and generator.py files to
   "/usr/local/lib/python[VERSION]/site-packages/mpd-myfm".
   You may need to add this path to the modulepath option in the config file.
 * Secondly place the mpd-myfm executable in root's $PATH.
   And make it executable (chmod +x).
 * If your system uses Upstart place a copy of the Upstart job file in
   "/etc/init/".
   If your system uses init.d copy the init.d script in "/etc/init.d/" (make 
   runlevel configurations to your likings).
 * Mpd-myfm looks for a config file at /etc/mpd-myfm.conf

This should do it. If you have any trouble getting mpd-myfm to run from the 
init.d script or Upstart job, try running it manually as root first.

The config file uses a format of 'OPTION = VALUE' the options are:
  hostname       = The hostname or ip address of the mpd server. (127.0.0.1)
  portnr         = The port number to use in the connection. (6600)

                   here.
  reconnecttime  = The time to wait before reconnecting on connection loss.
                   (60)
  repeatfactor   = The number of tracks to check for the same artist, and
                   reduce the possibility of adding a song by the same

  lastfmaccount  = The username of your last.fm account to find loved songs.
  pidfile        = The process id file to use to make sure you don't run more
                   than one instance of mpd-myfm. (No pidfile)
  modulepath     = Path to the directory containing the local modules.
                   ('/usr/local/lib/python[python_version]/site-packages/mpd-myfm')

  effectivegroup = The name of the group to run as when daemonized.
